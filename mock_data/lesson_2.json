Even if you didn’t, startup mentality and startup culture are popular in the tech world.\n\nMany startups have values that even big businesses are trying to adopt: quickly adapting to change; demanding high involvement; open, honest and transparent relationships; thinking outside the box and finding innovative, cost-effective solutions.\n\nIf you’re planning on creating your own business, thinking like an entrepreneur can help your personal development and career growth.\n\nFour steps for building a startup:\n1) Develop a vision for your product. Ask yourself what customer pain point you can solve, which gaps in the market you can fill, whether your solution is elegant and scalable, and whether you can pivot if you have to.\n2) Put together a great team. As a leader, you need to be in charge of hiring and bring people on board who match the company and share motivation and passion.\n3) Think about the logistics. Consider your location, expenses and annual budget. Incubators can help with low-cost equipment, mentorship, marketing/PR, pitching, accommodation and networking.\n4) Prepare your pitch. Pitching is delivering a concise, informative speech about yourself, your product or your company to people who can fund and mentor you.\n\nExtra: Incubators help startups discover an idea and create a business plan. Accelerators help startups with an existing MVP to grow and develop quicker.",
